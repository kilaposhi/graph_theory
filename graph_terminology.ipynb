    "\"Couplage maximal\" translates to \"maximum matching\" in English. In graph theory, a maximum matching is a matching (a set of edges without common vertices) that includes the largest possible number of edges.\n",

    "\"Chaine améliorante\" translates to \"augmenting path\" in English. In graph theory, an augmenting path is a path that starts and ends with unmatched vertices, and alternates between edges in the matching and edges not in the matching. Augmenting paths can be used to increase the size of a matching."
